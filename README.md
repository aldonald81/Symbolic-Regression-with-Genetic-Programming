# Symbolic-Regression-with-Genetic-Programming

In this experiment we were tasked with implementing symbolic regression to find optimal functions associated with 2
data sets: one with a single input variable and one with 3
input variables. We generated 2 genetic programs to fit equations to each data set. In our process, we researched and implemented established techniques of symbolic regression and
genetic programming to construct an efficient and optimal experiment. Our results found adequate equations mapping to
each data set. Experimental techniques varied from the first
data set to the second; the later data set required non-linear
scaling to find an equation with an appropriate fitness.
